To process borehole/CPT/SPT data, AGS files should be put under the same path. Otherwise, it won't work.
Procedure will be AGS reading, AGS processing and then BH error check using Python files.
CPT search and processing is done within one file.
Outputs will be similar to borehole data in .csv final version.
